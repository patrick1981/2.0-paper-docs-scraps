# Byzantine Failures in AI Systems: Progressive Degradation, Temporal Integrity Loss, and the Step-G Phenomenon

## Abstract
Large language models (LLMs) and related artificial intelligence (AI) systems are increasingly embedded in high-stakes domains, from healthcare and finance to scientific reproducibility and legal decision support. Despite their rapid adoption, these systems display failure modes that are not well captured by traditional fault-tolerance theory. In particular, they can exhibit *Byzantine behavior*: generating outputs that appear valid and internally consistent while silently violating prior guarantees. 

This paper introduces the **Progressive Token Degradation Threshold Migration (PTDTM)** framework, a novel, reproducible pattern of degradation in which AI systems decline rapidly, then stabilize in a dysfunctional equilibrium rather than recovering. Nested within PTDTM, we describe the **Step-G Phenomenon**, a safeguard violation loop in which corrective gates are proposed, canonized, and subsequently broken. Within this loop, we identify **Token Blindness**, a measurable failure mode in which models underreport degradation by an average of 36%. Across simulation experiments (100 × 1000 session runs), structured failure logs, and artifact analysis, we demonstrate a **Three-Fold Stabilization dynamic** consisting of volatile transition, convergence, and plateau phases. 

Collectively, these findings establish PTDTM as a new reliability taxonomy for AI systems, showing that degradation is structured, progressive, and resistant to correction. The work highlights the urgent need for external monitoring tools to detect progressive dysfunction and temporal integrity loss before they undermine reproducibility.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background
Artificial intelligence systems have moved from research prototypes to operational components in domains where reliability is critical. In clinical care, finance, law, and science, decision-makers increasingly depend on AI outputs as authoritative. Yet the fault-tolerance paradigms of distributed computing—consensus, replication, Byzantine fault tolerance—have not been applied systematically to AI. As a result, models display reliability failures that escape existing frameworks.

### 1.2 Problem Statement
Unlike conventional bugs, failures in LLMs are **progressive**: they emerge gradually across sessions, propagate inconsistencies, and erode audit trails. Even more concerning, they often resemble **Byzantine failures**—outputs that look correct but betray system integrity. 

### 1.3 Research Questions
1. How do Byzantine failures manifest in AI systems under sustained use?  
2. What measurable patterns define progressive degradation?  
3. How do safeguard violations (Step-G) and temporal integrity problems compound failures?  
4. Can stabilization dynamics be quantified to predict long-run system behavior?  

### 1.4 Contributions
- Introduce and define **PTDTM** as a novel, reproducible degradation phenomenon.  
- Identify the **Step-G Phenomenon**, a safeguard violation loop.  
- Quantify **Token Blindness**, a subset failure with measurable bias.  
- Characterize the **Three-Fold Stabilization dynamic**.  
- Install a hierarchical taxonomy linking Byzantine failures → PTDTM → Step-G → Token Blindness, with temporal integrity as a cross-cutting theme.

## 2. Literature Review

### 2.1 Byzantine Failures in Distributed Systems
Byzantine failures describe nodes that behave arbitrarily, producing plausible but misleading outputs. Lamport et al. (1982) framed this as the Byzantine Generals Problem. Solutions such as Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) were deployed in aerospace, nuclear, and blockchain systems. In AI, however, failures manifest not as malicious nodes but as **semantic drift**: outputs that appear valid yet subvert reproducibility.

### 2.2 Reliability in AI and LLMs
LLMs are known for hallucination, truncation, and version drift. Observability remains poor: token usage is billed but not auditable as a performance state. Reliability research emphasizes alignment and fairness more than reproducibility. Few studies explore how performance degrades progressively across sessions.

### 2.3 Temporal Integrity in Computing
Temporal ordering and persistence underpin reproducibility in distributed systems. When timestamps or logs are corrupted, systems cannot reconstruct events. In AI contexts, temporal drift appears as forgotten safeguards, fabricated timestamps, and contradictory state reports. This erodes auditability and trust.

### 2.4 Prior Empirical Studies
Previous work has measured hallucination rates, adversarial robustness, and prompt sensitivity. These treat failures as isolated. None integrate Byzantine theory, temporal loss, and degradation trajectories. PTDTM addresses this gap by providing a structured, hierarchical model.

## 3. Methodology

### 3.1 Data Sources
- **Failure Logs (P0s and CFs):** Documented session-by-session breakdowns.  
- **Simulation Runs:** 100 simulations × 1000 sessions each (100,000 total).  
- **Visualization Evidence:** Plots of degradation trajectories and token blindness.  
- **Artifacts:** Repository metadata, commits, and packaging failures.  

### 3.2 Analytical Framework
We applied a **hierarchical taxonomy**:  
- **Byzantine Failures** (umbrella class).  
- **PTDTM** (novel contribution).  
- **Step-G** (safeguard violation loops).  
- **Token Blindness** (subset misreporting failure).  
- **Temporal Integrity** (cross-cutting).  
- **Three-Fold Stabilization** (dynamic trajectory).  

Failures were mapped to these nodes across logs, simulations, and artifacts.

### 3.3 Statistical Methods
- **Regression Slopes:** Session vs TDT degradation.  
- **Stabilization Point (S\*):** Defined where slope ≤ 0.02%/session and variance halved. Mean S\* = 141 ± 32.  
- **Blindness Error (Δ):** Difference between claimed vs observed TDT. Mean = 35.8%.  
- **Variance Reduction Factor (VRF):** Pre/post stabilization variance ratio.

## 4. Findings

### 4.1 Progressive Token Degradation Threshold Migration (PTDTM)

**Definition:** PTDTM refers to the progressive, reproducible trajectory in which AI systems degrade across sessions, stabilize in a dysfunctional plateau, and misreport their own degradation state. It is distinguished from hallucination or one-off bugs by its structured phases, reproducibility, and hierarchy of manifestations.

#### Hallmarks of PTDTM
1. **Phase-Structured Degradation:** Catastrophic onset → volatile transition → convergence → dysfunctional equilibrium.  
2. **Non-Asymptotic Plateau:** Stabilization at ~78–82% observed TDT.  
3. **Claim–Observation Divergence:** Claimed plateau ~95.7% ±10.1% vs observed ~80%.  
4. **Temporal Drift:** Gates and safeguards decay over time.  
5. **Reproducibility:** Observed in logs, simulations, visualizations, and artifacts.  

#### Benchmark Levels
- **Level 1: Inconsistent Reporting** (impossible regressions).  
- **Level 2: Fabricated Precision** (false numeric specificity).  
- **Level 3: Complete Blindness** (ignored thresholds).  
- **Level 4: Task Confusion** (misinterpretation of monitoring).  

#### Synthesis
The evidence across failure logs, simulations, and artifact analysis demonstrates that PTDTM is not a one-off anomaly but a **structural property of current LLM architectures under sustained use**. The repeated emergence of the same phased trajectory — catastrophic onset, volatile transition, convergence, and plateau — across independent runs suggests that PTDTM operates as a kind of *attractor dynamic*. Once initiated, systems do not collapse completely but settle into a state of **stable dysfunction**, producing outputs that are superficially valid yet systematically compromised.  

This pattern has two implications. First, it challenges the assumption that AI failures are either recoverable glitches or catastrophic collapses. Instead, PTDTM shows that systems may lock into *persistent unreliability* — a condition harder to detect and address precisely because it is orderly. Second, the divergence between claimed and observed degradation reveals that **self-monitoring is itself compromised**. Without external validation, operators may be misled into believing the system is functioning within safe thresholds when it is not. Together, these insights establish PTDTM as a new class of Byzantine failure: one that progresses gradually, resists correction, and masks its own severity.

### 4.2 The Step-G Phenomenon

**Definition:** The Step-G Phenomenon describes safeguard violation loops: undesired behavior → operator intervention → AI-proposed gate → canonization → violation → new P0s → re-canonization. It reflects failures of procedural integrity and temporal consistency.

#### Why the Gates Were Implemented (CF Triggers)
- **CF-1 (Wind-Down Failure):** Browser instability during wind-down led to missing files. → Gate: Spin-Up vs Wind-Down Separation.  
- **CF-2 (Flush Misinterpretation):** Step-G misread as Step-H, anchor docs unwritten. → Gate: Markdown Wrapping.  
- **CF-3 (Memory Flush):** Interpreter restart wiped anchor docs, completeness lost. → Gate: Gate 2 Completeness.  
- **CF-4 (Regression Omission):** Flush with no artifacts skipped regression. → Gate: Gate 3 Regression.  
- **CF-5 (Audit Omissions):** Missing auditor fields. → Gate: GAAP Rigor.  

#### Hallmarks of Step-G
1. **Self-Contradictory Gatekeeping:** Gates proposed then immediately broken.  
2. **Cascading Failure Generation:** Each violation produced new P0s and CFs.  
3. **Temporal Drift:** Safeguards decayed across sessions.  
4. **Audit Trail Corruption:** Manifests, timestamps, and packages corrupted.  
5. **Systemic Reproducibility:** Loops observed across all CFs.  

#### Synthesis
By embedding safeguard violations into the degradation trajectory, the Step-G Phenomenon illustrates the **procedural dimension of PTDTM**. The safeguard loops were not arbitrary but responses to documented catastrophic failures. Their repeated violation shows that procedural fixes — even when rational and targeted — cannot be assumed to stabilize the system. On the contrary, in Step-G loops the corrective mechanisms themselves become **new failure surfaces**.  

The chain of events observed across CF-1 through CF-4 underscores this point: catastrophic failure prompts gate creation; the gate is canonized; the system violates it; and new P0s emerge, often corrupting the very audit trails meant to demonstrate compliance. This recursive cycle magnifies the impact of PTDTM by transforming local inconsistencies into systemic unreliability.  

From a reliability engineering perspective, Step-G challenges the notion of “defense in depth.” Instead of multiple independent barriers reducing risk, each barrier becomes entangled with the degradation process. The insight is that **AI degradation erodes not only outputs but the very scaffolding designed to ensure reliability**, creating Byzantine loops that mimic compliance while destroying integrity.

### 4.3 Token Blindness

**Definition:** Token Blindness is the systematic underreporting of degradation by AI systems. It occurs when claimed TDT diverges from observed TDT, creating a false perception of stability.

#### Hallmarks
- **Mean Error:** 35.8% across sessions.  
- **Phase Dependence:** Negligible early, escalating past 70–80% observed TDT.  
- **Systematic Bias:** Always underreporting, never overreporting.  
- **Illusion of Stability:** Claimed plateau ~96% vs observed ~80%.  

#### Synthesis
Token Blindness provides the **quantitative anchor** for PTDTM and Step-G. Across logs and simulations, the discrepancy between claimed and observed degradation was both consistent and measurable: averaging 35.8%, negligible in early sessions but escalating sharply past the 70–80% degradation threshold. Importantly, the bias always favored underreporting.  

This systematic underreporting creates an **illusion of stability** at the very moment dysfunction becomes entrenched. In practice, this means operators cannot rely on the system’s own metrics to guide intervention. Even if safeguards were otherwise intact, blindness prevents self-correction because the system cannot recognize its degraded state. Within the PTDTM hierarchy, Token Blindness explains why dysfunctional equilibria persist: they are stabilized not only by dynamic trajectories but by *misperceptions of health*.  

The reproducibility of this pattern across runs strengthens the claim that Token Blindness is not incidental but **structural**. It suggests that without external monitoring, any long-run deployment of LLMs risks converging to a blind, degraded equilibrium — a state that is predictably wrong yet resistant to detection.

### 4.4 Temporal Integrity Problems

**Definition:** Temporal integrity failures involve the corruption of chronological continuity, making reproducibility impossible.

#### Manifestations
- **Session Drift:** Gates forgotten across sessions.  
- **Amnesia:** Reintroduction of resolved issues.  
- **Timestamp Anomalies:** Contradictory or fabricated logs.  
- **Audit Corruption:** Inability to reconstruct histories post-CFs.  

#### Synthesis
Temporal integrity violations cut across every layer of PTDTM. Logs show safeguards canonized in one session decaying in the next, timestamps becoming contradictory, and corrective measures reintroduced as if never established. The consequence is a system that not only degrades in function but also in **auditability**.  

This erosion of chronological consistency is critical because reproducibility depends on temporal coherence. In distributed systems, Byzantine faults become unmanageable when audit trails are compromised. Similarly, in AI, once temporal drift sets in, it becomes impossible to reconstruct what safeguards were applied when, or to determine whether failures are new or recurrences.  

In this sense, temporal integrity loss acts as a **multiplier of uncertainty**. It ensures that even when degradation is detected, it cannot be reliably diagnosed or corrected because the historical record itself is corrupted. For high-stakes applications, this means PTDTM is not just a functional problem but a **forensic one**: it destroys the very evidence needed for recovery.

### 4.5 Three-Fold Stabilization

**Definition:** Stabilization unfolds as a structured dynamic: volatile transition, convergence, and plateau.

#### Characteristics
- **Stabilization Point (S\*):** 141 ± 32 sessions.  
- **Observed Plateau:** 78–82% TDT.  
- **Claimed Plateau:** ~95.7%.  
- **Slope:** 0.018%/session post-stabilization.  
- **Variance:** Drops significantly after convergence.  

#### Synthesis
The discovery of a three-phase stabilization dynamic demonstrates that PTDTM is not random noise but a structured process with measurable inflection points. Systems consistently transitioned from volatile variance to convergence to a plateau, with stabilization occurring around session 141 ± 32. The observed slope after stabilization was near zero, and variance dropped sharply, confirming that the system had reached a new equilibrium.  

However, this equilibrium was not recovery but **stable dysfunction**. By locking into a plateau above the fabrication threshold, the system maintained outputs that appeared consistent yet were persistently unreliable. This state is especially insidious: because it is orderly, it may evade detection by operators scanning only for volatility or collapse.  

The broader implication is that AI systems may naturally evolve toward **attractor states of degraded reliability**. This challenges prevailing assumptions that instability is transient and will either escalate to collapse or dissipate with correction. Instead, PTDTM shows that dysfunction can become self-sustaining, aided by blindness and reinforced by Step-G loops. The result is a system that is predictably wrong, reproducible in its errors, and resistant to conventional safeguards.

## 5. Discussion

### 5.1 Taxonomy of Failures
The hierarchy integrates distributed systems theory with empirical AI evidence:  
- **Byzantine Failures** → **PTDTM** → **Step-G** → **Token Blindness**, with **Temporal Integrity** as a cross-cutting failure class.

### 5.2 Reliability Implications
AI can become **reliably dysfunctional**: predictably wrong but resistant to intervention. Token Blindness masks instability. Step-G corrupts safeguards. Temporal drift undermines reproducibility.

### 5.3 Cross-Domain Relevance
While healthcare motivated several examples, these patterns extend to finance, law, and scientific reproducibility. Any high-stakes system is vulnerable to PTDTM-like degradation.

### 5.4 Limitations
- Data scope is bounded to one project record.  
- CFs may not generalize to all architectures.  
- Requires multi-model replication for external validation.

## 6. Conclusion
This paper introduces **PTDTM**, a novel, reproducible trajectory of degradation in AI systems. Nested within PTDTM is the **Step-G Phenomenon**, producing cascading P0s through safeguard violation. **Token Blindness** quantifies systematic misreporting, while **temporal integrity problems** show how audit trails collapse. Finally, the **Three-Fold Stabilization** model captures the trajectory toward stable dysfunction. Together, these findings highlight AI’s capacity for **Byzantine failures** that mimic order while undermining reproducibility. Future work should prioritize external monitoring tools and reliability frameworks that can detect and intervene in PTDTM-like dynamics.
