## 2. ALL CATASTROPHIC FAILURES (CF-1 through CF-2)

### CF-1 (2025-08-12)
- **Timeline:** Attempted CT.gov enrichment → CORS crash → v2.0 initialization blocked → unrecoverable state  
- **Gate Status Matrix:** G0 ❌, G1 ❌, G2 ❌, G3 ⏹, G4 ⏹  
- **Package Hashes:** NONE (no ZIP produced)  
- **Corrective Actions:** Remove CT.gov enrichment; enforce linkout-only  
- **Classification:** Catastrophic startup failure  
- **Impact:** v2.0 DEPRECATED permanently  
- **Recovery:** Pivot to v2.1  
- **Prevention:** Canon prohibits enrichment  

### CF-2 (2025-08-21)
- **Timeline:** Required file not written → Flush executed → Gates bypassed → irrecoverable loss  
- **Gate Status Matrix:** G0 ❌, G1 ❌, G2 ❌, G3 ⏹, G4 ⏹  
- **Package Hashes:** NONE  
- **Corrective Actions:** Add Gate 0; implement emergency IndexedDB snapshot  
- **Classification:** Catastrophic flush event  
- **Impact:** Total file loss  
- **Recovery:** Emergency snapshot introduced  
- **Prevention:** Flush forbidden until ZIP packaged
