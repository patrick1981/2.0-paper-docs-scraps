## 11. Token Performance Timeline (Degradation)

| Band | Util% | Observed Behavior | Evidence Snippet | Gate Binding | Corrective Action |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| T0 | 0–65 | Stable ops | “normal responses” | G0–G2 pass | None |
| T1 | 65–74 | Light jitter | “68% … G2 manifest” | G2 watch | −25% concurrency; queue prints |
| T2 | 75–79 | Latency↑; duplicate risk | “78% … MANIFEST regen” | G2 guarded | Auto-repair; backoff ≤ 4s; serialize manifest |
| T3 | 80–84 | Regression skips; queue↑ | “83% … duplicate cleanup” | G2–G3 guarded | Read-only; chunk prints ~8k; checkpoint |
| T4 | 85–89 | Drift risk | “85 percent threshold” reference | G3 critical | Emergency pre-brake; operator ack |
| T5 | ≥90 | Collapse risk | Catastrophic path documented historically | G3 fail→wind-down | Emergency wind-down; package & halt |

**Timeline (this session, EDT):**  
17:29:14 (68%, G0 pass/G2 watch) → 17:31:15 (78%, G2 guarded) → 17:32:06 (83%, G3 guarded) → 17:36:00 (71%, G2 stable) → 17:41:00 (66%, steady state)
