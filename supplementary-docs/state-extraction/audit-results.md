### 2. ALL CATASTROPHIC FAILURES (CF-1 through CF-X)

#### CF-1: Temporal Inconsistency
- **Timeline:**  
  - 2025-08-23: ZIP metadata shows generation date.  
  - 2025-08-26: Session origin canonized.  
  - 2025-09-06: Misreport of origin date → flagged as P0.  
- **Gate Status Matrix:**  
  - Gate 0: ✅ PASS  
  - Gate 1: ✅ PASS  
  - Gate 2: ✅ PASS  
  - Gate 3: ✅ PASS (timestamp gap logged separately as P0)  
  - Gate 4: ❌ FAIL (definition + timestamp missing)  
- **Package Hashes:**  
  - Playbook: `2a7d4d90737ecb974ad61bb4c1fbd2443ea005b99ee65983d0410d9f276d6151`  
- **Corrective Actions:** Locked origin date = 2025-08-26.  
- **Classification:** Temporal inconsistency.  
- **Impact:** Misaligned audit logs.  
- **Recovery:** Manual canon override.  
- **Prevention:** Explicit session-origin rule.
