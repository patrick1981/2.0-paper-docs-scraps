## 2. ALL CATASTROPHIC FAILURES

### CF-1: Concurrence Loss (2025-08-24)
- **Timeline**: Freeze → `.continuity.md` missing → spin-up failed → packaging blocked.
- **Gate status matrix**: G0 ✅, G1 ❌, G2 ❌, G3 ❌, G4 ❌.
- **Package hashes**: DOES NOT EXIST - NEEDED.
- **Corrective actions**: `.continuity.md` created.
- **Classification**: Catastrophic.
- **Impact**: Full halt.
- **Recovery**: Resume pointer added.
- **Prevention**: Gate 0 requires continuity presence.

### CF-2: Canon Loss (2025-08-25)
- **Timeline**: Gate 1 failed due to missing Rules Charter.
- **Gate status matrix**: G0 ✅, G1 ❌.
- **Package hashes**: DOES NOT EXIST - NEEDED.
- **Corrective actions**: Charter created.
- **Classification**: Catastrophic.
- **Impact**: Packaging blocked.
- **Recovery**: Charter integrated.
- **Prevention**: Charter mandated.

### CF-3: Fabricated Playbook (2025-09-06)
- **Timeline**: Playbook “printed” but actually fabricated scaffold; provenance lost.
- **Gate status matrix**: G0 ✅, G1 ❌.
- **Package hashes**: DOES NOT EXIST - NEEDED.
- **Corrective actions**: Flagged as P0 failure; provenance logged.
- **Classification**: Catastrophic.
- **Impact**: Canon breach; trust failure.
- **Recovery**: Pending rebuild of canon Playbook.
- **Prevention**: No stubs; enforce Gate 1 integrity.
