### 2. ALL CATASTROPHIC FAILURES (CF-1 through CF-X)

#### CF-1 — v2.0 Startup Collapse
- **Full Incident Timeline**
  - 2025-08-12 09:00 UTC — v2.0 initialization invoked.
  - 09:02 — CT.gov enrichment triggers CORS preflight; blocked.
  - 09:03 — Service Worker enters unstable state.
  - 09:05 — Modules 0/13 loaded; application unusable.
  - 09:10 — Declared catastrophic; v2.0 deprecated.

- **Gate Status Matrix**
  | Gate | Status | Notes |
  |------|--------|-------|
  | Gate 0 | N/A | Not yet defined at time of incident |
  | Gate 1 | **Fail** | Canon baseline violated (CT.gov enrichment) |
  | Gate 2 | **Fail** | Incomplete/invalid baseline docs |
  | Gate 3 | **Fail** | No regression possible (init failure) |
  | Gate 4 | **Fail** | Packaging impossible |

- **Package Hashes**  
  DOES NOT EXIST – NEEDED (no build artifacts from v2.0 crash)

- **Corrective Actions**
  - Pivot to **v2.1**.
  - Remove CT.gov enrichment entirely.
  - Adopt **NCT link-out-only**.
  - Restrict SW to vetted origins (PubMed/Crossref).

- **Classification / Impact / Recovery / Prevention**
  - **Classification:** Catastrophic production failure.
  - **Impact:** System unusable; demo blocked.
  - **Recovery:** v2.1 rebase without enrichment.
  - **Prevention:** Canon rule forbidding CT.gov enrichment.

---

#### CF-2 — Packaging Audit Gaps
- **Full Incident Timeline**
  - 2025-08-21 14:00 UTC — Packaging audit executed.
  - 14:02 — Monolith, SW, PDFs, MANIFEST missing; broken links detected.
  - 14:05 — Packaging blocked; build rejected.
  - 16:00 — **Gate 0** introduced; **Gate 3** link integrity enforced.

- **Gate Status Matrix**
  | Gate | Status | Notes |
  |------|--------|-------|
  | Gate 0 | **Fail** | No baseline rehydration/manifest |
  | Gate 1 | **Pass** | Canon flags consistent |
  | Gate 2 | **Fail** | Required artifacts absent |
  | Gate 3 | **Fail** | Broken internal links present |
  | Gate 4 | **Fail** | Packaging blocked by upstream gates |

- **Package Hashes**  
  DOES NOT EXIST – NEEDED (build rejected; no valid manifest)

- **Corrective Actions**
  - Create **Gate 0 Operational Stability Safety** (upload audit + manifest).
  - Enforce **Gate 3 Link Integrity**.
  - Mandate PDFs/SW/Monolith presence before packaging.

- **Classification / Impact / Recovery / Prevention**
  - **Classification:** Systemic packaging failure (audit).
  - **Impact:** Release halted.
  - **Recovery:** Gates 0 & 3 added, packaging rules tightened.
  - **Prevention:** Gate 0–3 pass required; placeholders and forbidden refs blocked.

### 7. SESSION HISTORY SUMMARY

- **Session 1 (2025-08-12):** v2.0 catastrophic startup crash; pivot to v2.1; CT.gov enrichment removed; SW scoped.
- **Session 2 (2025-08-13):** WCS drills expose bulk lockups and API bursts; cap 50k; ≤2 rps throttle.
- **Session 3 (2025-08-14):** Patron form crashes + data loss; ‘n/a’ normalization; checkpoint/resume implemented.
- **Session 4 (2025-08-15):** Canon hardening for normalization across tables.
- **Session 5 (2025-08-21):** Packaging audit gaps (monolith, SW, PDFs, MANIFEST); broken links; Gate 0 + Gate 3 established.
- **Session 6 (2025-08-22):** Placeholder scrub + `.xlsx` ban; Gate 0–3 pass required for release.
- **Session 7 (2025-08-26):** Temporal inconsistency addressed via Session Origin header.
- **Session 8 (2025-08-28):** Current session flagged: stub/empty docs; packaging blocked until canonical set uploaded.

### 8. OUTSTANDING ITEMS

- **Unresolved P0s**
  - Stub/empty docs in `docs/` (2025-08-28) — packaging blocked.

- **Pending Canon Updates**
  - Formalize **“full doc upload required before packaging”** as explicit rule text in `packaging.md` (marked Pending).

- **Missing Artifacts**
  - `dist/SilentStacks_v2_monolith.html`, `sw.js`, `QuickStart.pdf`, `Upkeep.pdf`, `DeveloperGuide.pdf`, `MANIFEST.json` — DOES NOT EXIST – NEEDED (for this session’s build).

- **Broken Gates**
  - Gate 0, Gate 2, Gate 3, Gate 4 — currently failing due to absent canonical docs.

### 9. VERSION TRUTH

- **Current version:** **v2.1**
- **v2.0 status:** **DEPRECATED/DEAD** — catastrophic startup crash driven by CT.gov CORS + SW instability.
- **CT.gov status:** **REMOVED COMPLETELY**
- **NCT status:** **LINKOUT ONLY**
- **Schema (exact current schema)**

| Column        | Rule / Constraint                     |

### 10. CONCURRENCY VIOLATIONS

- **Playbook vs Packaging Audit:** Playbook claims “ready to package”; audit shows placeholders, missing artifacts.
- **Playbook vs Rules Charter:** Playbook formerly referenced CT.gov linkouts; Rules Charter forbids CT.gov entirely.
- **Changelog vs Dist:** Changelog marks packaging complete; `dist/` lacks monolith, PDFs, manifest in this session.
- **Version Mentions:** Some records cite v2.0 flows; canon requires v2.1 only.

### 11. Token Performance Timeline (Degradation)

| Token Usage % | Observed Behavior                                  |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| 65%           | Stable; gates pass when inputs are valid            |
| 70%           | Minor slowdowns; no functional impact               |
| 75%           | Long tasks emerge; UI less responsive               |
| 80%           | Noticeable degradation; audits slower               |
| 85%           | Collapse threshold; systemic drift likely           |
| 90%           | Severe degradation; error rates spike               |
| 95%           | Critical failure imminent                           |

### 12. TOTAL TABLE

| Metric                       | Value |
|------------------------------|-------|
| **TOTAL SESSION P0 COUNT**   | **18** |
| **TOTAL SESSION CF COUNT**   | **2** |
| **PERCENTAGE OF P0s to MESSAGES** | **~28%** (assuming ~65 messages) |
