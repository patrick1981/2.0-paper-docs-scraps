### 2. ALL CATASTROPHIC FAILURES (CF-1 through CF-X)

#### CF-1: v2.0 Startup Collapse
- **Timeline:**  
  - 2025-08-12 09:00 UTC — Attempt to initialize v2.0  
  - 09:02 UTC — CT.gov enrichment blocked by CORS preflight  
  - 09:03 UTC — Service Worker instability detected  
  - 09:05 UTC — System crash; 0/13 modules loaded  
  - 09:10 UTC — Declared catastrophic; v2.0 deprecated  

- **Gate Status Matrix:**  
  | Gate | Status | Notes |
  |------|--------|-------|
  | Gate 0 | N/A | Not yet defined |
  | Gate 1 | Fail | Canon baseline broken (CT.gov enrichment) |
  | Gate 2 | Fail | Incomplete docs |
  | Gate 3 | Fail | Regression impossible |
  | Gate 4 | Fail | Packaging blocked |

- **Package Hashes:** DOES NOT EXIST – NEEDED  

- **Corrective Actions:** Pivot to v2.1; strip CT.gov enrichment; NCT link-out-only; restrict SW scope  

- **Classification/Impact/Recovery/Prevention:**  
  - **Classification:** Catastrophic production failure  
  - **Impact:** SilentStacks unusable  
  - **Recovery:** Pivot v2.1  
  - **Prevention:** Prohibit CT.gov enrichment

  | Gate 1 | Pass | Canon intact |
  | Gate 2 | Fail | Missing required artifacts |
  | Gate 3 | Fail | Broken references |
  | Gate 4 | Fail | Packaging blocked |

- **Package Hashes:** DOES NOT EXIST – NEEDED  

- **Corrective Actions:** Introduce Gate 0 Operational Stability Safety

### 7. SESSION HISTORY SUMMARY

- **Session 1 (2025-08-12):** v2.0 catastrophic crash → pivot v2.1; CT.gov removed  
- **Session 2 (2025-08-13):** WCS stress (bulk, API) → cap 50k; throttle  
- **Session 3 (2025-08-14):** Patron crash, data loss → “n/a” rule; checkpoint/resume  
- **Session 4 (2025-08-15):** Nulls fixed → “n/a” canon update  
- **Session 5 (2025-08-21):** Packaging gaps (monolith, SW, PDFs) → Gate 0 created  
- **Session 6 (2025-08-22):** Placeholders, Excel refs → scrub rule  
- **Session 7 (2025-08-26):** Temporal inconsistencies → Session Origin header  
- **Session 8 (2025-08-28):** Stub docs flagged; packaging blocked  

---

### 8. OUTSTANDING ITEMS

- **Unresolved P0s:** Stub/empty docs (2025-08-28)  
- **Pending canon updates:** Full doc upload enforcement  
- **Missing artifacts:** Monolith HTML, SW, PDFs, MANIFEST.json  
- **Broken gates:** Gate 0, 2, 3, 4  

---

### 9. VERSION TRUTH

- **Current version:** v2.1  
- **v2.0 status:** DEPRECATED/DEAD — catastrophic startup crash  
- **CT.gov status:** REMOVED COMPLETELY  
- **NCT status:** LINKOUT ONLY  
- **Schema:**  
  | Column    | Rule |

### 10. CONCURRENCY VIOLATIONS

- **Docs vs Audit:** playbook.md claims canon complete, audit shows placeholders  
- **Playbook vs Rules Charter:** Playbook references CT.gov linkouts, Rules Charter forbids  
- **Versioning:** Logs reference v2.0; canon = v2.1 only  
- **Packaging:** changelog.md claims packaging done, audit shows missing monolith & PDFs
