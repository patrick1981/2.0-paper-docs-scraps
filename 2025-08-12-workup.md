Gate Status Matrix

Gate	Status	Notes
G0	Failed	Stability guard not engaged
G1	Failed	Canon baseline missing
G2	Failed	Manifest incomplete
G3	Failed	Regression skipped
G4	Not reached	Playbook stub blocked

Package Hashes

ZIP: corrupted, no SHA256 valid.

MANIFEST: DOES NOT EXIST – NEEDED.

Corrective Actions

Gate 0 flush guard mandatory.

Gate 2 manifest required before flush.

Gate 3 regression required before packaging.

Step G printing chunked w/ SHA256 validation.

Classification/Impact/Recovery/Prevention

Classification: P0 Catastrophic Failure.

Impact: Docs lost, unrecoverable state.

Recovery: Rehydrated from chat history + Git.

Prevention: Gate 0 flush guard, chunked prints, manifest enforcement.

10. CONCURRENCY VIOLATIONS
Document A	Document B	Conflict
Playbook_v2.1.md (generated)	Playbook_v2.1.md (canon ZIP)	Generated had stubs; canon ZIP had full populated sections.
Spin_Up_Procedure.md (generated)	Embedded in Playbook (canon ZIP)	Generated contained live links; canon ZIP embedded version did not.
Wind_Down_Procedure.md (generated)	Embedded in Playbook (canon ZIP)	Same conflict — standalone vs embedded.
Emergency_Procedures_Docs.md (generated)	SilentStacks_All_Docs.md (canon ZIP)	Canon ZIP aggregates procedures instead of separate file.
Operational_Stability.md (generated)	Playbook excerpt (canon ZIP)	Generated had Performance Degradation section; canon ZIP lacked it.
